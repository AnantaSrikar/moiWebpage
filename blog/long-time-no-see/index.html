			<h1>Long time no see</h1>
			<p>
				It's been a very, very long time since I last wrote a blog, I blame it on the ongoing pandemic.
				Thus I thought of posting an update, and here it is.

				A lot of things happened since the last time, few of them being bagging the second place in a hack week,
				doing 2 internships, and becoming the Vice-President for my Uni's Computer Science club, <a target="_blank" href="https://mec-enigma.github.io/">Enigma</a>,
				and conducting many sessions and finally, the coolest thing, building my PC.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Begin the quarantine: CovIndia</h2>
			<p>
				My quarantine had begun with me working on <a target="_blank" href="https://covindia.com/the-legacy/">CovIndia</a>, the biggest project
				I've ever been a part of. With that said, I was busy for 3 whole months. I started by collecting data the whole day (literally the whole day, starting at 7 AM and ending at 11 PM),
				and then we got more people into the Data Acquisition team, as the number
				of cases was rising and things started to get out of hand. So that meant we got no time for ourselves.
				Hence we got more people into the Data Acquisition team, which slightly eased the load.
			</p>

			<p>
				Even with that, one month into the pandemic, it became very difficult to manage and verify the number of covid cases.
				Our news sources were all over the place, and it was very chaotic. Eventually, we realized Twitter was
				a good place for reliable updates since there were specific reporters for every state, who'd tweet out
				new updates instantly. The catch was we had stayed on the lookout for new tweets.
			</p>

			<p>
				This gave me an idea to make a bot for keeping a track of all these tweets. I quickly built a basic
				Twitter bot that would re-tweet any tweet that had a specific set of words in it. I must say that I
				didn't expect much from it, as it was a single <code>if</code> statement. It managed to get a 90-ish%
				accuracy. I quickly set up the Slack integration for Twitter, and we had our alpha version of a fully
				functional Covid tracker bot. I decided to call it <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/covindia/CovIndia-DataAcquisition/tree/master/Sam">Sam</a> (Yes, the very same one from Marvel), and do note
				that it had a bodyguard named <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/covindia/CovIndia-DataAcquisition/blob/c8c8db0db138eb2f54662058d32482cc2b04ad48/Sam/startSam.py#L23">Red Wing</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Eventually, we also needed a program to check if our cases were tallying with the State count. For that,
				I made another bot which used Slack API and called it <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/covindia/CovIndia-DataAcquisition/tree/master/tallyBot">TallyBot</a> (simple and cute). It was made to check the different totals,
				which helped us verify the correctness of our data. Code for both the bots can be found <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/covindia/CovIndia-DataAcquisition">here</a>.
				I even got the opportunity to work on CovIndia's backend and made a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/covindia/CovIndia-BigDataBox/commits?author=AnantaSrikar">few PRs</a>. 
			</p>

			<p>

				But alas, all good things must come to an end. On 31-May-2020 16:00:00, <a target="_blank" href="https://covindia.com/">covindia.com</a> shut down after
				nearly 2.5 months of running. It had become increasingly difficult for us (the Data Acquisition team) to
				keep collecting data, as you know the number of cases started increasing super exponentially. And along
				with that online classes started, which would make things difficult to handle.
			</p>

			<h2>My First Internship</h2>
			<p>
				As CovIndia was coming to an end, I realised it was time to find something else to work on. Landing an internship was my main idea,
				but do note, it's technically impossible for a first-year engineering student to get an internship. This is because
				first years usually know little to nothing. But then me being a nerd, I did know something, and wanted to
				use what I knew in real life. With all this in mind, I began searching for an internship.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I made a
				resume keeping in mind my current interest at that time, machine learning. I scoured for days on multiple
				internship hunting platforms, with no luck. And oh boy, not to forget the 'Pay to get an internship'
				offers'. When I felt that all hope was lost, my Uni's Vice Chancellor had sent a mail about a 'free'
				internship opportunity, which had many topics like IoT, Robotics and of course, Machine learning.
				Besides that, it had a 'Tie up' with <strong>IBM</strong>, so it was more attractive 🎉🎉	.
			</p>

			<p>
				I immediately applied and in 5 minutes,
				I had got a mail saying that I'd have to take a test, and if I pass, then only I'd be getting to intern
				with them. Without further ado, I took the test (on my phone, and it was a <i>big mistake</i>). The
				website where I had to take that test, was made ONLY for desktops. But somehow, I had manged and passed it.
				The test consisted of 20 MCQs, based on various topics like basic coding (both C and Python) and the math
				behind Machine learning.
			</p>

			<p>
				A few days later, I get a mail asking me to join a slack Workspace. There were 200 more students
				there doing the same thing. We were asked to make a customer care chatbot using IBM cloud applications.
				We had many online meetings where they would teach us how to use the IBM cloud applications to
				achieve the final goal. In about 15 days, I completed it, and to be honest, it was fairly simple.
				My project was evaluated at the end of the month, and I had completed my first internship! 🥳
			</p>

			<br>
			<p>
				That's all for now. I'd probably make a part - II for this blog because way too many things happened, and I don't
				want to spam it with all the details at once. Who doesn't want another blog?
			</p>

			<p>
				Anyways, until next time.
