			<p><h1>About me</h1></p>
			<p>I was in love with computers from when I was a kid. I loved playing video games on them, and wanted to know how they worked. I never really understood how and why they worked until my 8th class. I was taught the basic logic of some problems, the syntax. Almost instantly I loved the programming language. From then on, I've decided that I'l dedicate my life to coding. I code most of the day. I'm a very creative problem solver. This enables me to make the back-end work very seamlessly. My daily schedule definitely has some coding in it. I like listening to Lo-Fi while working. I am well versed with C, C++, Java, Python and SQL. I know a little MatLab, C#, HTML, Javascript (not a big fan). I've done some basic projects using Arduino(refer my GitHub). My 12th CBSE board exam project was a Hotel management system, coded in C, used file handling(and got full marks for it). I have some expertise with Android Studio. I've also developed a Chatting App in Android Studio using Firebase as the online database. I also made a discord bot, which which gives the user the current weather of a given city, and can update you with the latest Indian and International news. It also has the basic capability of Administrative controls(like kick, ban, etc). Also made a telegram version of the bot, with lesser features. Making of the discord bot increased my fluency with python. It's currently hosted on my trusty Raspi 4 B+ 4GB edition. Also, quite recently I have made my first CNN which can differentiate between an image of cat and dog, with 98% accuracy(yaay?) using keras. Did I mention that I'm a Black Belt holder in karate(Yes, that too 1st dan). I also love swimming, playing tennis, football, basket ball and cricket. I'm a little towards sports, and would play to take a break from the mundane routine. I also love having long talks with my friends, which mostly end up being techy, and they end up not understanding much. I love helping people(and only those who deserve it). That makes me feel more confident about what I really like and what I know about.I'm also a quick learner, so whenever I get a chance, Google, YouTube, or any other free online courses. I love music with heavy beats and deep basses. Besides programming, I love listening to music, solving the Rubik's cube, Fixing things(not code, but real life things), and just love exploring. I'm also the kind of guy who likes doing his own stuff. After I got to know the existence of SSDs (lmao I didn't know it before). I'm in deep love with my laptop, my very trusty companion for all my coding expertise. I currently live in the hostel of my college, Mahindra Ecole Centrale. I love my college. Made some really cool friends. Hope to learn even more than that I did before. I look forward to what coding life has to give.</p>
