			<h1>How I made this website</h1>
			<p>
				Alright. This one is unnecesarrily long for the first post. I might as well write my life story, smh. 
				I finally got to make my website. And this means I get to write blogs (yay!). With all this in 
				mind I decided to make a post on how I made this website. It ain't much, but it's honest work.
			</p>
			
			<h2>The Beginning</h2>
			<p>
				The idea of making my website struck me when I first saw a lot of my seniors have their websites, each one
				with their stunning design (obviously). I instantly wanted to make one for myself. After a little bit of googling, I
				figured out how to host static web pages (more about them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">here</a>)
				on GitHub. However, I realised that website making just isn't as easy as it looks. It requires one to know how
				to make proper arrangenment of objects in the page using HTML and CSS. I barely knew HTML , and CSS
				was a nighmare to me. I had seen some very, very big files of CSS in source codes of some websites which I had
				hardly understood, causing me to freak out instantly, and from then on keep a good distance from it.
			</p>

			<p>
				This fear persisted until I participated in the <a href="https://hackonload.com/">OnLoad</a> hackathon. We used Django for
				our project, <a href="https://github.com/AnantaSrikar/RecommendWAh">RecommendWah</a>, and therefore had a some web pages 
				as our user interface. I was firm that I would work on anything other than the website, hence that washandled
				by my team mates. On the second night of the hackathon, we were almost complete (maybe) with our project. 
				We just had to squash a few bugs and connect the Machine Learning model to the Django server (we couldn't,
				that's for another day). The login page needed to have the text entry and buttons placed in the centre.
				I looked into the issue, only to notice that it was because of the CSS. I tried to close it off, yet
				something was persuading me to try and fix it. A little bit of searching revealed that adding two CSS
				tags,to the element will fix it. Upon copy-pasting them, the
				page showed up just as we needed it to be. I had conqured my fear of CSS! Our team ended up earning a 
				special mention at the end of the hackathon.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Breaking the barrier</h2>
			<p>
				After getting rid of my unusual hatred, I started craving for making my website. I couldn't start off as
				there were too many assignments leaving no time for learning web-dev. Then came the COVID-19 pandemic.
				Unexpected, but still a dream come true for many, me being one of them. We get all the time we ever wanted.
				And fortunately for me, I got to be a part of <a href="https://covindia.com/">CovIndia.com</a>, the first live district-wise 
				COVID-19 tracker. It ran for a good 2.5 months (click <a href="https://icecereal.github.io/blog/i-made-a-website-that-hit-a-million-views-in-2-weeks/">here [Raghav's blog]</a>
				to see a more detailed explanation).
				I might make a post for that as well. After that, I had literally nothing to do. Atlast, I had all the time in
				the world. I start learning web-dev. I leant HTML from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>, and 
				CSS from some YouTube videos. I still wasn't sure how exactly it worked, but I got the jist of it.
				Even so, I wasn't able to build what I pictured.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The thing was I wanted to make my website from scratch, and not just import a template,
				which is way more simpler. But that way I would end up learning nothing. Kudos to  my senior, <a href="https://icecereal.github.io/">Raghav</a>
				for guiding me on this one.
			</p>

			<h2>Finishing off..</h2>
			<p>
				Enter Coursera, which nicely offered most of the courses for free to all college students due to the pandemic. 
				I scoured throught the different courses availabe for web-dev and chose <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers">HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web
				Developers by Johns Hopkins University</a>.
				The course was definitely worth taking, as it helped me understand how the browser renders code, different
				ways of positioning elements, the grid layout, and even basic Javascript along with making dynamic pages
				using AJAX requests. I was finally ready to make my website. I started off by making
				the basic template for how I visualized my website. I slowly started loosing interest in building it, and was
				trying out other cool things like making a timelapse with pictures taken and stiched on a Raspi. I would like
				to thank <a href="https://mec-enigma.github.io/">Enigma</a> for conducting the HackWeek-4, which gave the oomph I needed to resume the work on
				my website. I continued making a navbar, during which I learnt about flexbox, which was easier than
				the grid design, and is also responsive, making the job easier. I was able to make my website from scratch!
				Indeed, I did learn a lot, by not using pre-made themes.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I still have a lot of things up my mind for this website. Well, that's all for now. Huff, thanks for reading
				this far, if you did. 🙂
