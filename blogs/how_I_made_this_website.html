			<h1>How I made this website</h1>
			<p>
				I finally got to make my own website. And this means I get to write blogs (yay!). With all this in mind,
				I decided to make a post on how I made this website. It ain't much, but it's honest work.
				This one is unnecessarily long for the first post. I might as well write my life story, smh. 
			</p>
			
			<h2>The beginning</h2>
			<p>
				The idea of making my website struck me when I first saw a few of my seniors' websites, each one
				with their own unique style (obviously). Instantly, I wanted to make one for myself. After a little bit of googling, I
				figured out how to host <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">static web pages</a>
				on GitHub. However, I realised that website making just isn't as easy as it looks. It requires one to know how
				to make proper arrangement of objects in the page using HTML and CSS. I barely knew HTML, and CSS
				was a nightmare to me. I had seen some very, very big files of CSS in source codes of some websites which I had
				hardly understood, causing me to freak out instantly, and from then on keep a good distance from it.
				This fear made sure I ignored the existence of web-dev, and conviniently dabbled in other interesting topics
				like Comp-coding, IoT, and so on.
			</p>

			<h2>Breaking the barrier</h2>
			<p>
				This fear persisted until I participated in the <a href="https://hackonload.com/">OnLoad</a> hackathon, conducted in Mysore.
				Me along with two other batchmates, teamed up for our project, <a href="https://github.com/AnantaSrikar/RecommendWAh">RecommendWah</a>
				We used Django and therefore had some web pages as our user interface.
				I insisted on working on anything other than the website, hence that was handled
				by my teammates. On the second night of the hackathon, we were almost complete (maybe) with our project. 
				We just had to squash a few bugs and connect the Machine Learning model to the Django server (we couldn't,
				that's for another day). The login page needed to have the text entry and buttons placed in the centre.
				I looked into the issue, only to notice that it was because of the CSS. I tried to close it off, yet
				something was persuading me to try and fix it. A little bit of searching revealed that adding two CSS
				tags, <code>margin-right: auto</code> and <code>margin-left:auto</code> to the element will fix it. Upon copy-pasting them, the
				page showed up just as we needed it to be. Voila! I had conquered my fear of CSS! Our team ended up earning a 
				special mention at the end of the hackathon.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				After getting rid of my unusual hatred towards web-dev, I started craving for making my website. Overloaded with 
				multiple assignments, I had no time left for learning web-dev. Then came the COVID-19 pandemic at March 2020.
				We were thrown out of our hostel and our classes were suspended. But before I vacated, something amazing
				happened. Little did I know that a call from my senior would get me into the core team of a very large and
				important project, <a href="https://covindia.com/">CovIndia.com</a>.
				It was the first live district-wise COVID-19 tracker for India
				(<a href="https://twitter.com/anandmahindra/status/1240270762638020608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">tweeted</a> by Anand Mahindra and
				<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/how-i-made-it/story/engineering-students-create-india-s-first-district-wise-covid-19-tracker-1659707-2020-03-25">covered by media</a>!)
				It ran for a good 2.5 months and I had to dedicate about 10 hours a day
				(click <a href="https://icecereal.github.io/blog/i-made-a-website-that-hit-a-million-views-in-2-weeks/">here</a>
				to see a more detailed explanation).
				On 31st May, 4:00 PM IST, CovIndia gave it's last update.
				After that, I had nothing to do. At last, I had all the time in
				the world. I started learning web-dev. I learnt HTML from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>, and 
				CSS from some YouTube videos. I still wasn't sure how exactly it worked, but I got the gist of it.
				Even then, I wasn't able to build what I imagined.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The thing was I wanted to make my website from scratch, and not just import a template,
				which is way simpler. If I had done that, I would end up learning nothing in web-dev. I would like to express
				my gratitude to my senior, <a href="https://icecereal.github.io/">Raghav</a> for guiding me on this one.
			</p>

			<h2>Finishing off..</h2>
			<p>
				Enter Coursera, which nicely offered most of the courses for free to all college students due to the pandemic. 
				I scoured through the different courses available for web-dev and chose <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers">HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web
				Developers by Johns Hopkins University</a>.
				The course was worth taking, as it helped me understand how the browser renders code, different
				ways of positioning elements, the grid layout, and even basic Javascript along with making dynamic pages
				using AJAX requests. It was so engrossing that I zipped off the course in just 2 weeks. I was finally armed to make my own website. I started by making
				the basic template for how I visualized my website. 
				<a href="https://mec-enigma.github.io/">Enigma</a> HackWeek-4 was the trigger that ignited my drive to complete creating
				my website. I set about making a navbar, during which I learnt about flexbox, which was easier than
				the grid design, and is also responsive, making the job easier. I was able to make my website from scratch!
				Indeed, I did learn a lot by going through the hard work of making everything on my own.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I still have a lot of things up my mind for this website. Well, this is only the beginning of a long journey. Whew, thanks for reading
				this far, if you did. 🙂
